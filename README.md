# raccoonOS
a small x86 operating system

This really isn't anything much, not much code has been written yet.

Currently this OS will be built for i386, but hopefully I will build it for x64 in the future.

Planned:
- Everything a basic OS has: GDT, IRQ, ISR, etc
- Basic networking - RTL8139 driver
- A GUI
- A basic shell
- Basic syscalls
